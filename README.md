# DataFromCOD

This reprository contains the scripts used to filter the Crystallographic Open Database (COD) (TODO:  add link) and obtain the initial library used to create the first inorganic 3D benchmark model for de novo design.

NOTE: this repository make use of a version of COD dowloaded with rsync on the 10/06/2024. Although the most desirable way to downaload the COD would be using Subversion, the resulting download is very resource expensive (> 200 GB of memory used), so the database was dowload with rsync following the COD instructions.
In this repository there will not be the database as it exceeds the dimensions allowed by a Github repository.
